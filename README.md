# üß† Customer Churn Prediction

A project focused on analyzing and predicting customer churn using Machine Learning (Random Forest), SQL, and Power BI.

---

## üìå Project Goal

To identify customers with a high probability of churn based on historical data and provide business stakeholders with actionable insights through visual analytics and predictive modeling.

## üîß Technologies Used

- üìä **Power BI** ‚Äî to visualize key business metrics and churn patterns
- üêç **Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)** ‚Äî for data preprocessing and model training
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQL (T-SQL)** ‚Äî to extract and prepare data from source systems
- üå≤ **Random Forest** ‚Äî classification model to predict churn likelihood
- üìà **Seaborn/Matplotlib** ‚Äî to visualize feature importance and model insights
